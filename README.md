Full Stack Authentication & Validation Project

Tech Stack: React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT, Joi, Bcrypt

Description:
This project is a full-stack authentication and input validation exercise designed to demonstrate secure communication between the frontend and backend using modern web technologies. The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, handling user authentication, validation, and API endpoints. The frontend, developed using React.js, provides an interactive user interface for registration and login operations.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Implemented secure login and signup functionality using JWT (JSON Web Token) for token-based authentication.

Password Security: Applied bcrypt for password hashing to ensure user credentials are safely stored.

Data Validation: Used Joi for both frontend and backend input validation, ensuring consistency and data integrity across the application.

Protected Routes: Only authenticated users can access certain routes or data, improving app security.

Error Handling: Comprehensive error messages for invalid inputs or authentication failures.

Frontend Integration: React frontend communicates seamlessly with Express backend via RESTful APIs.

Learning Outcomes:

Gained hands-on experience with secure authentication workflows.

Practiced form validation and API request handling on both client and server sides.

Strengthened understanding of Express middleware, token verification, and state management in React.
